Performance Comparative of Deep learning based Super-Resolution Models ,SRCNN and EDSR, for Image Quality Enhancement
## Abstract
This thesis presents a comprehensive comparison of two advanced super-resolution (SR) models: the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) and the Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution Network (EDSR). The objective was to evaluate and analyze their performance in enhancing image quality, specifically focusing on the application of these models to upscale images by factors up to four times as well as eight times their original resolution. For this purpose, we employed the high-resolution DIV2K dataset for training, and assessed the models' performance on two standard testing datasets: SET5, SET14, and one new challenging dataset: RELLISUR, which contains normal light images and corresponding low light images.

The methodology involves rigorous training followed by quantitative evaluations based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), alongside qualitative assessments to judge perceptual quality. Our findings indicate that while EDSR generally outperforms SRCNN across standard testing datasets, particularly excelling at the highest magnification of 8Ã—, it does not maintain this superiority in low-light conditions found in the RELLISUR dataset. This performance disparity highlights the impact of architectural enhancements in EDSR, which are designed to effectively handle larger scaling factors without the computational inefficiencies typically introduced by increased model depth and complexity.And the underperformance of these models in low-light conditions indicate the need to improve super-resolution algorithms to handle variable lighting conditions.

The significance of our study lies in its detailed comparison of these two models, providing insights that could be pivotal for future research and practical applications in super-resolution. This thesis not only contributes to the ongoing advancements in deep learning-based super-resolution techniques but also serves as a valuable reference for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements and constraints in various application domains.
